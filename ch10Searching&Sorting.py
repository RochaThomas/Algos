# cracking the coding interview
# chapter 10 searching and sorting

# interview questions

# 10.1 sorted merge
# merge two sorted arrays where array a has a long enough buffer at the end to fit array b
# start at the last number of each array, compare and add to end of array a

# 10.2 group anagram
# sort a list of string so that all anagrams of each other are next to one another
# make a hashmap where key is a sorted string and value is an array of strings, add string to array if it matches
# key when sorted, return hashmap values

# 10.3 search in rotated array
# given a sorted array that has been rotated x times find a target value
# the books solution is subpar and unclear, watch neetcode video for this problem
# just a modified binary search
